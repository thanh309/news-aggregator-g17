"Guest","Industry Talk","|The ICO for 2024’s new store of value [SOV] altcoin, Mollars (MOLLARS), is pushing quickly towards US$1,500,000. Today the project’s initial coin offering moved to 72%, leaving less than 28% of the tokens allocated for the presale available for purchase.|What Is Mollars?|The new altcoin is highly popular because it’s the answer to Bitcoin for Ethereum Blockchain’s 250-million wallet holders. A digital store-of-value asset, deflationary in nature, Mollars has an advantage on $BTC because of its blockchain. Ethereum-blockchain is faster, cheaper to use, and more scalable.|Virtually it lacks all the deficiencies of Bitcoin and even eliminates the risk of the ‘stashed wallets’ owned by BTC founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. Mollars is possibly the only cryptocurrencies with ‘true decentralization’ of its class in terms of branding value & utility. The founders nor developers will be given free tokens of its 10-million total token supply.|That simple policy of the cryptocurrency eliminates token dumps or market manipulation.|Mollars & Dogecoin have this in common|Unknown to some, Dogecoin is possibly the only cryptocurrency in the top 10 that’s ‘truly decentralized’ as its owners took no free tokens either. Thought of as a joke by the founders, but done with no intent to indulge in self-greed, thanks to Elon Musk & various Fortune 500 companies, the $DOGE has become a globally recognized crypto.|Mollars could be on a similar trajectory.|Even though it’s not yet listed on exchanges, Mollars search volume is skyrocketing as it nears its June 1st close date. Google trends reports a major breakout for the keyword terms Mollars, Mollars ICO, Mollars.com, and Mollars crypto.|Crypto Traders Search for “Mollars” Half as Much As Pepe Token|Apart from breakout keyword terms, “Mollars” has also skyrocketed in terms of search volume. Some days the brand name’s search volume reaches just under half (50%) that of “Pepe token,” which is the 27th most traded cryptocurrency today.|Search volume is generally received as ‘branding value’ in business today, hinting that Mollars may be on the cusp of a major break out in the crypto space.|Three cryptocurrency exchanges have already announced they will list the new store of value altcoin. Bitmart, LBank, and XT will each allow its millions of users access to the token upon the presale’s end on June 1st.|Token Stats|With only 10-million tokens being minted ever of the new cryptocurrency, Mollars is expected to sell out and see a hyper-parabolic uptrend in price if it moves past 5-million tokens sold.|To date, nearly 3-million $MOLLARS have been sold to crypto traders via the token presale [Mollars.com]. It’s currently being sold for $0.55 cents per token via the ICO event.|Mollars will launch on crypto exchanges at a price of $0.62 cents next month, June 1st, if hard cap is reached. That is a +12% increase of today’s price.|If popularity continues to swell, prices could become substantially greater according to reports from various cryptocurrency news outlets and its respected analysts.|YouTube channel analyst, Ari of Crypto News suggested the price could see a 20x increase (+2000%) in value based on tokenomics and project infrastructure.|CryptoNews on-site analyst Klimnet Dukovski suggests a potential high of $6.|Both projections were made over 4 months ago when Mollars ICO had raised less than $150,000 (USD) raised and under 350,000 tokens were sold.|Today, the project is nearing $1.4-million-dollars in funds raised and almost 3-million tokens sold.","0","https://cryptonews.com/news/mollars-crypto-half-as-popular-as-pepe-token-according-to-google-trends.htm","","","Mollars Crypto Half as Popular as Pepe Token According To Google Trends","Article","Cryptonews"

"Arslan Butt","Bitcoin News","As Bitcoin hovers near the $67,000 mark, trading at $67,243.75 with a recent upswing of 1.41%, questions about its next milestone intensify. With a trading volume of $24.62 billion and a dominant market cap of $1.32 trillion, the prevailing sentiment is cautiously optimistic, stirring discussions on Bitcoin price predictions for an imminent new high.|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish, as BTC’s pivot point is established at $66,680, which is pivotal in determining the direction of Bitcoin’s price movement. The immediate resistance level is observed at $69,296, and breaching this level could indicate potential gains ahead.|Further resistance is identified at $71,090 and $72,809, with surpassing these levels possibly signaling strong bullish momentum and potentially setting new highs for the cryptocurrency.|Conversely, immediate support is found at $64,662, with a fall below this level potentially leading to tests of further supports at $63,299 and $61,517.|Bitcoin Price PredictionA decline beyond these points could increase selling pressure, driving the price downwards.

As SHIB faces resistance, all eyes are now turning towards its competitor, Retik Finance (RETIK), set to launch on May 21, promising a new era in decentralized finance (DeFi).|Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rebound: A Bumpy Ride|Following a period of volatility, Shiba Inu (SHIB) had shown signs of recovery, with its price attempting to surpass the $0.000025 resistance level. However, this rebound hit a roadblock as SHIB struggled to maintain its upward momentum, leaving investors uncertain about its future direction. Despite its strong community and widespread popularity, Shiba Inu (SHIB) faces challenges in sustaining its price momentum amid broader market dynamics. As the crypto market evolves, investors are seeking alternatives with promising growth potential and innovative features. The cryptocurrency market, known for its unpredictability, often presents challenges even to well-established tokens like Shiba Inu. While SHIB’s community remains fervent and its popularity widespread, maintaining price momentum in the face of evolving market dynamics is proving formidable.

This is done through data collected by Amberdata, which tracks traded crypto pairs across over 150,000 spot, options, and futures instruments.|“ARC shows token addresses, contract and trade specifications, price limits, exploits, and more,” said Henderson. “ARC IDs also map an asset’s associated instruments across the digital asset ecosystem, using a tagging classification system to flexibly classify industries and proper use cases.”|Henderson believes that such a tool can help institutions with analysis and reference, trading, and for other instances.|“For example, ARC will help institutions keep records of the highly dynamic universe of digital assets with a repository of accurate asset and classification information for reference and analysis,” she said. “It can also optimize execution workflows to enhance trade execution strategies.”|Data To Evaluate Digital Asset Risk|Institutions also require data management tools to evaluate risks associated with digital assets.|A recent Deloitte poll shows that executives involved in managing digital assets expect risks to increase and the regulatory environment to become more complex this year.|Tim Davis, a Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory principal and U.S. Blockchain Leader, believes, “Digital asset risk should be a mainstay board agenda item for any organization that actively uses digital assets in its operations.”|Given this, a Chainalysis spokesperson told Cryptonews that institutions could use Chainalysis on-chain data to evaluate risks associated with digital assets.|“For example, we can help clients understand how widely distributed an asset is, how liquid it is, what segments of the crypto economy are holding and using it, and whether those segments skew toward being illicit or risky,” the spokesperson said.|Will Institutions Implement Digital Asset Management Tools?|Since digital assets represent a fairly new sector for institutions, it is questionable if data management tools will be immediately implemented.|Yet Henderson noted that Amberdata expects institutions to use ARC moving forward.|“We have heard from many financial institutions and crypto native firms – both clients and not – that mapping assets across exchanges and markets is a major pain point across the trading life cycle,” she remarked.|Henderson added that Amberdata has already initiated the process of ARC integration for a few institutions. She further pointed out that because ARC is open-sourced, it will advance within the digital asset industry through community contributions and insights.|“There is a vast community of financial professionals and digital asset investors who will contribute to ARC, keep the dataset relevant and up to date, and eliminate proprietary biases on how to classify digital assets,” she said.|Yet challenges may arise.

However, there is still a gap in the financial education that people have, which is why Trade Evista 100 advertises itself as a conduit of financial wisdom.|Promising to connect learners with esteemed academic institutions, this platform reportedly serves as a guiding beacon, steering people toward better education. How true is this claim? Read this review to find out.|Trade Evista 100 Summary|Cryptocurrencies are unregulated. Trading with unregulated brokers will not qualify for investor protection.|What is Trade Evista 100?|Investment principles can be too intricate for some to understand. The technical jargon is too complex, and the strategies required can be too nuanced at times. To navigate this maze of issues, a simple platform has to be designed. Trade Evista 100 advertises itself as one.|Claiming to directly connect learners with “esteemed academic establishments”, this platform asserts that it is here to help investors worldwide.|It states that it “abstains” from dispensing direct investment counsel, instead relying on third-party academic institutions to help learners. These educational institutes reportedly help users learn about various forms of investments and investing assets in a simpler fashion.|The website’s overly eloquent tone also suggests that Trade Evista 100 provides a large library of resources and provides investment education in many ways.|Although it is not clear, we have some reasons to believe that Trade Evista 100 might deliver tutorials through blogs, videos, and even one-on-one trading.|According to the website, this platform covers topics such as investment principles, deciphering the language of investments, and understanding asset diversification. The platform suggests that educators ensure that the learning curve becomes less steep so that grasping key details becomes easy.|However, there is no information online to support these claims. Third-party reviews are not available, and first-hand accounts from learners who have used this platform are not available either.|These factors cast doubt over this platform’s legitimacy, which makes it important for learners to take each step properly.|Trade Evista 100 – Pros and Cons|Upon reading the content available to us on the official website, here are the core pros and cons we could find:|Pros|Cons|How Does Trade Evista 100 Work?|Trade Evista 100 says nothing about how it works. However, we were able to decipher some of its operative methods from the jargon-filled content it has presented on the website.|It all begins with a simple sign-up process, which also requires a phone number. During the registration process, users may be contacted by a customer support representative.|The process may also involve a user divulging how much they know about investments, which may then prompt Trade Evista 100 to connect them to an appropriate educational company.|Then, learners may begin their education. How they will be provided lessons, however, is not clear. A few sections on the homepage make it seem like standard learning modules, such as articles and videos, are present.|The website claims that each module will be customized to a learner’s level of investment knowledge. Quizzes and assignments might be involved, and simulated conditions may also be provided for users to practice what they have learned.|If our assumptions are true, Trade Evista 100 can be a good platform to learn about investments. However, all of the information we have just given you is only a guess. It is better to talk to the customer support team about the signup process.|Trade Evista 100 – Features|Here are some of the core features that Trade Evista 100 has listed on its website.|Simple Sign-up Process|Like many educational platforms before it, Trade Evista 100 also states that its website architecture is streamlined, which facilitates a seamless registration process. The site claims that it takes less than 10 minutes, and investors can start their learning journey quickly.|Quality Connections|Since Trade Evista 100 works as an intermediary, it claims that the educational companies it has partnered with are of high quality. The platform claims that it delivers “systemic guidance tailored to preferences and learning goals.” If true, this means that users won’t feel overwhelmed during their learning sessions.|Covering Multiple Subjects|Trade Evista 100 claims to cover multiple subjects, allowing investors to learn about the “myriad of intricacies” of the financial ecosystem. This educational platform claims that even novices may benefit from it, and veterans will have a chance to improve their skills.|Simplifying Complex Subject Matters|The learning curve of financial education can be steep. This website claims to simplify that with the aid of educators who understand the deeper meaning of all the technical jargon. Reportedly, they ensure that users don’t have any trouble when navigating the market once the lessons are complete.|No-Cost Registration|According to the website, users won’t need to pay anything during the registration process. Only entering small details is required, and it will create an account for learners to start getting acquainted with investment methodologies.|Multi-Device Support|According to the website, Trade Evista 100 is available on multiple devices, even though it only has a web application. The platform is responsive enough, per the claims, to allow even mobile users to learn about investments comfortably.|Cryptocurrencies are unregulated. Trading with unregulated brokers will not qualify for investor protection.|Trade Evista 100 Fees|The only detail given at the bottom of Trade Evista 100’s home page is that there are “no additional charges” when it comes to fees. We found that very confusing since even simple fee details aren’t available. The platform doesn’t discuss having a subscription model, nor does it talk about cost-per-tutorial.|It indicates that learners may be able to learn about the fees they must deposit by talking to partner education companies.|Trade Evista 100 Minimum Deposit|Trade Evista 100 doesn’t portray itself as an auto trading platform, which also means that there is no need for a minimum deposit. However, considering the limited information we have access to, there might be some hidden trading-related functionalities on this website. They may require a minimum deposit, but it is all a guess. Therefore, this is another detail we recommend that investors discuss with the customer support team.|Is Trade Evista 100 a Scam?|Even when a platform is only claiming to provide financial education, it is important to learn whether it is a scam or a legitimate website. However, getting the right answer in the case of Trade Evista 100 is not easy.|For one, the language it uses is too complex and not in a good way. The entire web page has been written to showcase the quality of the content, not the quality of the services available.|This made it difficult for us to check out the features it may deliver. Scam-ridden sites often use this to confuse readers and entice them into signing up.|Secondly, the website has only provided bare-bones information about the kind of services learners can get from it. Even though it has clearly stated that it doesn’t offer education but uses third parties to do so, there is no information about those parties.|This may have been a strategic move to prevent readers from directly learning from the parties without using the intermediary that Trade Evista 100 portrays itself as.|Fee details and founder-related details are also absent, which gives us some pause since it is very important for a site like this to be transparent.|On the flip side, though, the official website looks good. The buttons work, and the texts are readable. We also didn’t encounter any grammatical mistakes as we reviewed the content. This might not be enough to avoid discounting the platform as a scam, but it shows that the website has some integrity.|Since there is no clarity about Trade Evista’s legitimacy, we recommend talking to the customer support team and waiting for more reviews to arrive before using this platform.|How to Use Trade Evista 100?|For those who want to learn about the deep intricacies of the financial ecosystem from Trade Evista 100, here are the steps to follow:|Step 1 – Create an Account|Users must first leverage the reportedly simple sign-up process to create an account on Trade Evista 100. The process, as they say, doesn’t require much effort. Only small details, like name, email, and phone number, are needed.|Step 2 – Find an Education Company|The platform may then reach out to you via a customer support representative who will be asking questions about how much you know. Depending on your knowledge-level, you may be assigned an educator.|Step 3 – Start Learning about Investments|The final step is to start learning about investments from these educators. Whether users will get a link from Trade Evista 100 to gain access to the learning modules or they will get a link to the educator’s website is not clear. Whatever the case may be, start learning about investment when you finally get the modules.|It is also important to judge what you have learned. Always confirm the lessons you receive by going to YouTube channels or other top crypto Discord servers to see if what you’re taught is worth something.|How to Delete a Trade Evista 100 Account?|Trade Evista 100 doesn’t talk about the account deletion process. However, there might be a button on the dashboard that could provide this facility. We recommend checking out after account creation. Alternatively, investors can talk to the customer support team and get their accounts removed.|Have Celebrities Endorsed Trade Evista 100?|Trade Evista 100 has just launched. It hasn’t established a renown on the market, and it doesn’t mention any celebrity support. So, no, there are no celebs standing behind Trade Evista 100 for now.|Who is the Founder of Trade Evista 100?|Keeping up with the trend of other prominent educational websites we have reviewed before, Trade Evista 100 doesn’t reveal anything about the platform’s founders. We don’t know who they are, and the website doesn’t even post links to their social media handles. Trade Evista 100’s founders have embraced anonymity, which they had no reason to do since the site doesn’t have any trading facilities.|Latest Bitcoin News|Here are the latest Bitcoin news for the week ending on 18th May 2025:|The Verdict – Is Trade Evista 100 Legit?|Only financial education services are highlighted on the official Trade Evista 100 website. While this is an interesting prospect, there is no proof that the lessons provided are effective. Third-party reviews are nowhere to be found, and customer testimonials don’t exist yet. This points to the fact that this website is still untested.|The website’s content uses fancy language, which doesn’t give us a clear insight into its features.

"Prateek Arora","Sponsored","Disclaimer: The text below is an advertorial article that is not part of Cryptonews.com editorial content|It is no surprise that when the crypto market is volatile, people need tools to help them with their trading pursuits. With Immediate Flow, however, these tools are merged with educational facilities, reportedly giving users access to an “all-in-one” platform that offers unique learning and earning opportunities.|Promising to help traders master the art of trading while also aiding them in the matters of learning about investments, Immediate Flow states that it forms alliances with leading trainers and tool providers. Are these claims true? Find out in this Immediate Flow review.|Immediate Flow Summary|Cryptocurrencies are unregulated. Trading with unregulated brokers will not qualify for investor protection.|What is Immediate Flow?|Bitcoin has started to surge again, and many postulate that this “summer of easing” will put the crypto market back into the bull phase. However, this is not certain, and many people are aware of this, which is why investors are looking for tools that help them make logical decisions.|There are two ways to go about it. One is through education so that every decision has a weight of information behind it. The second is through autonomous trading platforms: AI trading bots that take over the trading tasks of users.|Immediate Flow claims to be a tool that offers both of these facilities. It asserts that it offers a suite of sophisticated instruments and resources, making investors well-equipped to navigate the ever-changing crypto landscape and generate profits. It advertises that 80% of its users generate profits, giving a hint at its accuracy rate.|In addition to these tools, investors may also expect to gain access to multiple educational resources. These resources are reportedly provided by top-tier training institutions and learning hubs that have garnered a lot of accolades over the years.|The platform asserts that all the blogs and other information provided inside the educational materials have gone through a lot of scrutiny so that investors have access to good learning modules. These lessons are reportedly offered in the form of video tutorials, with a minor focus on blogs and articles as well.|These AI-fueled solutions, which are apparently prevalent in both trading and training modules, are well-received by the community. However, there is no proof to back that claim. Most of the information provided on the platform is similar to our previously reviewed trading sites, and like them, there are not many logical third-party reviews available online.|Due to several inconsistencies in this platform, we recommend doing your due diligence before using this crypto trading and training website.|Immediate Flow – Pros and Cons|As we read through the complex terminologies and fanciful content that the website presents, we found the following pros and cons:|Pros|Cons|How Does Immediate Flow Work?|Since the platform itself works as a combination of an education website and a trading system, we believe that once users sign up, they can choose between the following modes.|Learning Mode|Now, the learning mode may be accessed as soon as one comes to the website. Many crypto courses might be available, including how to trade crypto, how to use automated trading systems, and how to get started with presales.|If the website does have a tiered structure, it might be that users first need to be interviewed to get an educational institution assigned to them for better education.|They may also be able to switch from one training mode to another, provided they have learned enough to level up.|While the platform mostly discusses AI-enabled trading systems, users may also learn about trading charts, and this might be where they receive crypto signals.|Trading Mode|Trading mode is where those who want to trade crypto assets can go. Immediate Flow hasn’t highlighted what features users must expect. However, it has become clear to us that an AI crypto trading bot is involved.|This trading bot may analyze the price history of an asset and match it with the current macroeconomic conditions to make an investment decision. The platform states that 80% of its users are able to generate profits, which means it may have a win rate of 80%.|However, most of the information we have provided is a guess. The site might function entirely differently. There might also be a manual trading system involved. Or, there might be robo-advisors, too, helping traders invest in assets.|Immediate Flow – Top Features|Here are some of the core features that Immediate Flow has listed on the official website:|Free Registration|According to the website, users will get access to free registration. The platform claims that its “ethos is rooted in fostering an egalitarian investing environment,” which means it claims to deliver an inclusive ecosystem where everyone can trade properly.|High-Quality Investment Firms|To help investors with trading, Immediate Flow has reportedly partnered with high-quality investment firms. These firms reportedly offer a host of features to make trading free of latency and complications.|High-Quality Academic Institutions|The platform also claims to have partnered with high-quality academic institutions, which help users learn about cryptocurrencies and other forms of investment. These firms reportedly have a multi-level training structure so that everyone can learn at their own pace.|Round-the-Clock Customer Support|According to the website, users will get access to round-the-clock customer support. These support services will reportedly help investors navigate the trading systems properly and without any issues. However, whether or not they will help with investors’ trading endeavors is a different matter altogether.|Safe Trading Environment|According to the website, users will get access to a safe trading environment. This information hints at the availability of high-quality security features. However, the website hasn’t highlighted the names and nature of those features.|Video Tutorials|According to the website, Immediate Flow delivers training through video tutorials, which is a good option for those who want to learn about trading quickly. It magnifies a learner’s learning capacity, helping them become better traders quickly.|However, none of those training videos have been displayed on the official website. That being said, these video tutorials apparently teach traders about in-depth research, risk management, and reinvesting profits.|Cryptocurrencies are unregulated. Trading with unregulated brokers will not qualify for investor protection.|Support for Multiple Assets|Even though Immediate Flow has highlighted that cryptocurrencies are the primary asset it supports, it also mentions CFDs, forex, and mutual funds. This indicates the presence of asset diversification opportunities for investors.|Immediate Flow Fees|Immediate Flow doesn’t discuss its fee structure. It merely states that the platform is free to use. However, the FAQ section at the bottom of its home page states that different education and trading firms can have their own charges. Therefore, once users sign up on the website, they may get the required information about the site’s fee structure.|It is recommended to only move forward if the fee structure provided is feasible.|Immediate Flow Minimum Deposit Requirement|Even though half of the services that Immediate Flow offers are related to trading, the platform hasn’t given us any information about its minimum deposit.|However, because multiple third-party trading firms are reportedly involved, different ones might have different minimum deposit requirements. Talk to the customer support team during the sign-up process for more details.|Is Immediate Flow a Scam?|With its dual systems that offer training and trading to investors, Immediate Flow makes many claims. It asserts that 80% of its users generate a profit while highlighting that its educational tools are second to none.|Both of these claims are not verified by third-party reviews or first-hand customer testimonials. Even though we did come across multiple reviews of the site, most of them seem marketing-driven, only highlighting key positives while completely ignoring some of the platforms’ negative attributes.|Furthermore, even though the site does say that it offers AI-fueled trading systems, it doesn’t highlight its core features properly. We have guessed that it might have an AI crypto trading bot from the fact that it states that 80% of its users generate profits.|We don’t know its customization options or what other tools people will have access to.|The same issue is with the platform’s educational resources. We don’t know what they are. Even though it claims to offer video tutorials, it refuses to give us a peek.|The root of these issues is the jargon-filled text with too much decoration that makes the content look more complicated than it is. The tone is suspiciously similar to other other websites we have reviewed.|Therefore, considering these factors, we don’t know whether it is a scam or a legitimate crypto trading platform.|How to Use Immediate Flow?|Below are the steps to get started with Immediate Flow:|Step 1 – Go to the Official Website|The first step is to go to the official Immediate Flow website and create an account. Enter key details before proceeding. You may get an email or a call for verification.|Step 2 – Pick a Trading firm/Training Firm|Depending on your requirements, you may now need to pick between a trading firm and a training firm. If you have chosen a trading firm, ask about the minimum deposit requirement. Use that information to make the deposit using PayPal, wire transfer, or credit card. The details are given on the website.|To choose a training firm, answer the questions truthfully so that your expertise in crypto investments can be assessed.|Step 3 – Start Learning/Trading|Once you have taken all the necessary steps, start learning or trading. If you have chosen to trade, invest only the minimum amount. If you’re a learner, make sure to take knowledge from multiple sources.|How to Delete an Immediate Flow Account?|Immediate Flow doesn’t discuss the process of deleting the account. We recommend asking the customer support team for instructions. Alternatively, you can check to see if there is an option to terminate the account in your dashboard.|Who is the Founder of Immediate Flow?|Immediate Flow doesn’t offer any information about its founders. The About Us page is only full of vague information with no valuable content. The platform’s founders are anonymous, which may have been a deliberate decision since most crypto-related platforms, except for the biggest ones, don’t reveal the names of their owners.|Have Celebrities Supported Immediate Flow?|Immediate Flow doesn’t have any celebrity support right now. That might have to do with the site’s age. It has just recently been released, which means it may grow with time. But considering the lack of transparency, it is unlikely it will reach heights that give it celebrity interest.|Latest Bitcoin News|Below are the latest updates related to Bitcoin:|The Verdict – Is Immediate Flow Legit?|It is unclear whether Immediate Flow is legit.

"Arslan Butt","Bitcoin News","Bitcoin is trading just above $65,000, experiencing a 1.25% correction after a recent surge. This upward movement was driven by weaker US CPI data, dovish FOMC sentiment, and a break from a symmetrical triangle pattern.|Despite this slight bearish correction, the Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish, especially with Andrew Tate’s announcement to invest $100 million in Bitcoin and decreasing BTC supply on exchanges.|Bitcoin Supply on Exchanges Hits New Lows Amid Bullish Market|Bitcoin (BTC) supply on centralized exchanges (CEX) has dropped to new lows following strong market activity over the past 48 hours. According to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the Bitcoin supply on exchanges is now at 1,728,782 BTC, reflecting a significant decrease as bullish sentiment grows.|In the last 24 hours, 23,654 BTC exited exchanges, with weekly outflows reaching 19,859 BTC. Monthly flows were also down, with only 9,509 BTC moving. This reduction suggests increasing bullish pressure as traders move their assets off exchanges.|Key Points:|This week, several traditional finance firms disclosed their exposure to spot Bitcoin ETFs, further driving prices up.|Andrew Tate Plans $100M Bitcoin Investment|Andrew Tate, a British-American social media personality and former professional kickboxer, has announced plans to invest heavily in bitcoin, expressing his dissatisfaction with traditional banks and their practices.|“I’m about to leave fiat completely,” Tate declared. “I’m done with banks and their scams.”|Tate shared his plans on the social media platform X, stating his intention to move away from fiat currency and invest $100 million in bitcoin.|I know I’m not supposed to do this in chaotic times but I’m about to leave fiat completely and ape over 100M into btc.|And I’ll even prove I did it.|I’m done with the banks.|I’m done with their money.|Done with the scams.|Then I’m going boating.|— Andrew Tate (@Cobratate) May 15, 2024|He emphasized his frustration with the banking system and expressed confidence in his decision, even planning to showcase his investment proof later.|Key Points:|Andrew Tate, known for his controversial online presence and previous career as a kickboxer, has been involved in cryptocurrency-related news before.|Romanian authorities seized significant assets from him, including Bitcoin.

It has already completed a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement around the $64,750 level, which is currently acting as major support for BTC and is also today’s pivot point. As long as Bitcoin holds above this level, the chances of a bullish bounce are high.|In this scenario, the immediate resistance is likely to be around the $66,600 level. If Bitcoin breaks above this level, the next resistance would be around $67,820, with $69,000 acting as a further hurdle.|Conversely, if the market continues to show a bearish correction, breaking below the $64,750 level could send BTC down to the $63,300 level.|Additionally, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the four-hour time frame is likely to support BTC around the $63,150 level, increasing the chances of a bullish bounce from this level. However, increased selling pressure could drive a bearish crossover below the 50-day EMA, with $61,500 or $61,200 likely to act as further support levels.|Lastly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has already exited the overbought zone and is currently holding around 62, which is still in bullish territory.|Current Trend: We need to keep an eye on the $64,750 and $63,300 levels, as these are crucial for buyers.

"Guest","Press Releases","|In a groundbreaking move that has set the traditional finance world abuzz with excitement, Real World Assets (RWAs) are swiftly gaining traction within the crypto and blockchain sphere. Spearheaded by the recent surge in interest from major players like BlackRock, the convergence of real-world assets with blockchain technology is poised to revolutionize the global financial landscape.|BlackRock’s Impact on Asset Tokenization|BlackRock’s foray into the realm of tokenized assets with the launch of its BUIDL fund on March 20 sent shockwaves through the industry, attracting a staggering $240 million in inflows. This move underscored a pivotal shift in the market, signaling the increasing acceptance of asset tokenization as a viable investment avenue. As investors seek to marry the stability of traditional assets with the innovative potential of blockchain, the demand for RWAs has surged, prompting a flurry of activity in the sector.|MANTRA’s Role in Real World Asset Tokenization|At the forefront of this burgeoning trend is MANTRA, a Cosmos-based layer-1 blockchain platform dedicated to unlocking the value of RWAs. In a recent interview with us, MANTRA CEO John Patrick Mullin shed light on the challenges and opportunities inherent in tokenizing tangible assets, emphasizing the pivotal role of blockchain technology, particularly the Cosmos network, in facilitating this transformative process.|“BlackRock’s BUIDL fund has ignited a global interest in asset tokenization,” remarked MANTRA CEO John Patrick Mullin. “The success of this initiative has underscored the viability of tokenized assets as a mainstream investment avenue, driving unprecedented attention to the convergence of traditional finance with blockchain technology.”|🎙️ #MANTRA CEO & Co-Founder, @jp_mullin888 shed light on how MANTRA is bringing RWAs to Cosmos at @token2049.|He also shared key insights on establishing regulatory-compliant infrastructure for tokenizing #RWAs. #Token2049 $OM pic.twitter.com/ZTRh2jQJyi|— MANTRA | Tokenizing RWAs (@MANTRA_Chain) April 19, 2024|Challenges and Considerations in Tokenization|According to Mullin, tokenized assets represent a paradigm shift in the investment landscape, offering enhanced utility and liquidity by digitizing real-world assets on the blockchain. Drawing parallels with BlackRock’s visionary stance on asset tokenization, Mullin highlighted the potential for distributed ledgers to revolutionize securities markets, paving the way for instantaneous settlement and enhanced transparency. “The next generation of markets will be the tokenization of securities,” Mullin exclaimed, echoing sentiments expressed by BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink. “They will provide a distributed ledger for all owners and sellers and instantaneous settlement, among other benefits, which changes the entire ecosystem.”|However, Mullin cautioned that while the potential for RWAs is immense, significant hurdles remain in terms of technical and regulatory considerations. “The system isn’t perfect today,” Mullin acknowledged, stating that “many technical and regulatory considerations” need to be addressed. Despite these challenges, MANTRA has been actively involved in pioneering projects within the RWA ecosystem, particularly in Dubai, where the platform has witnessed a surge in demand for tokenized real estate assets.|Navigating Regulatory Landscapes|In the UAE’s booming real estate market, RWAs have emerged as a game-changer, offering unprecedented flexibility and efficiency in asset financing. By tokenizing real estate assets, firms can streamline the borrowing process, reducing costs and unlocking new avenues for investment. Mullin cited the example of a major Dubai real estate developer, which leveraged RWAs to sell over $1.5 billion of its newest development in just six months, highlighting the transformative potential of asset tokenization.|Despite the immense promise of RWAs, regulatory approval remains a key consideration for tokenization initiatives. Mullin revealed that MANTRA is engaged in discussions with UAE regulators to obtain the necessary licenses, underscoring the region’s openness to blockchain innovation. However, he acknowledged the challenges posed by regulatory frameworks in other jurisdictions, emphasizing the need for ongoing dialogue and collaboration between industry stakeholders and regulators.|Technical Foundations of Asset Tokenization|For MANTRA, the selection of a technically robust network capable of handling billions of transactions was paramount in their pursuit of asset tokenization. Thus, the company opted for the Cosmos SDK for its protocol layer. CEO Mullin underscored the decision, highlighting Cosmos as “incredibly robust” and “battle-tested.” He pointed to events such as the rise and fall of algorithmic stablecoin Terra-Luna, which ran on Cosmos, as evidence of the network’s reliability. Mullin emphasized Cosmos’s ability to handle tens of billions in volume and hundreds of thousands of transactions seamlessly, even under immense pressure.|What sets Cosmos apart, according to Mullin, is its capacity to enable projects to scale beyond the platform itself. Unlike Ethereum or Solana, which may not see projects surpass their native networks, Cosmos has witnessed several of its native projects exceed its own capabilities, such as Terra-Luna and Celestia at different points in time. This flexibility and scalability inherent in Cosmos make it the preferred choice for MANTRA in their pursuit of revolutionizing asset tokenization.|Future Projections and Market Outlook|Looking ahead, the tokenization of real-world assets is poised to unlock trillions of dollars in illiquid assets, revolutionizing the way assets are managed and transacted globally. With the market for tokenized assets projected to reach $16 trillion by 2030, the transformative potential of asset tokenization cannot be overstated. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, platforms like MANTRA are at the forefront of driving innovation and reshaping the future of finance.","0","https://cryptonews.com/news/from-wall-street-to-your-street-every-asset-becomes-an-investment-opportunity-through-tokenization-says-mantra-ceo.htm","","","From Wall Street to Your Street, Every Asset Becomes an Investment Opportunity Through Tokenization, says MANTRA CEO","Article","Cryptonews"

In July 2019, he described them as “not money” and condemned their volatility and absence of intrinsic value. Additionally, he contended that these assets could facilitate illegal activities such as drug trafficking.|Crypto’s Role in Shaping Voter Preferences|According to Coinbase, about 20% of American adults, or over 50m individuals, claim to hold crypto. Markus Levin, co-founder of XYO Network, said that this substantial figure has undoubtedly captured the attention of the candidates.|“To embrace crypto and solid crypto regulation is a good election strategy and clever policy more generally,” he said. “Absolutely, a sizable number of people in the crypto community will vote for Trump based on his seemingly positive approach towards the industry.”|Meanwhile, Jonathan Thomas, CEO of prime brokerage Blueberry, asserted that Trump’s crypto-friendly stance will influence voters prioritizing crypto as a single-issue matter.|“This is an aspect that some people hold dear to their hearts, and will vote for which candidate supports their bias,” he said. His crypto-friendly talk will resonate with crypto enthusiasts, but only if it doesn’t clash with other issues they care about even more, he added.|Skepticism Surrounding Donald Trump’s Crypto Advocacy|NFT enthusiast Thorne Melcher labeled Trump’s recent endorsement as “flimsy.” She noted it marks a significant departure from his previous negative remarks.|“Given crypto’s potential to facilitate the purchase of trans hormone replacement therapy, abortions, and drugs circumventing politics pushed by conservatives, it only feels like a matter of time before they involve it in their authoritarian crackdowns,” she said.|However, she noted that this doesn’t imply that Biden is favorable towards cryptocurrency. Yet, supporting Trump solely for the sake of crypto doesn’t seem to offer substantial benefits, and Trump himself is unlikely to gain much electoral support solely by endorsing it.|Trump’s Strategy to Woo Crypto Voters Away from Biden|Once a crypto skeptic, Trump has now become a full-fledged NFT enthusiast. He actively participates in the market, even selling over $1m worth of NFTs, some featuring his mugshot.|According to Stephanie Vaughan, co-founder of DeFi protocol Veda, it’s evident that many individuals within the crypto community are inclined to support Trump or refrain from supporting Biden.|“I think that during the last election, there were probably a lot of crypto-focused voters who voted for Biden. Because, at that time, it wasn’t clear that he would take such a hardline approach against the industry,” she said.|“It’s clear now, however, that regulation by enforcement is the stance taken by the Biden Administration. And this is totally unworkable for a very large number of people who work in the industry or who are generally favorable towards it.”|She said that Trump acknowledges crypto’s emergence as a significant factor for a considerable portion of voters in the upcoming election.

"Guest","Press Releases","|Recently, the SEC decided to pursue Ripple (XRP) for $2B as its legal battle heats up. Meanwhile, Tether (USDT) has increased its investment in CityPay, a payment service. Amidst these developments, all eyes are on Rollblock (RBLK) – a Stage 1 presale star. Analysts claim that this altcoin could surge 1200% in 2024. Let’s see why.|The SEC Demands Ripple (XRP) To Pay $2B|The SEC is continuing its legal battle against Ripple (XRP). In a recent filing, the SEC demanded that Ripple pay $2B, which is a way larger amount than what Ripple offered. In April 2024, Ripple offered to pay a $10M fine. The SEC believes that this amount is not appropriate.|Amidst this Ripple news, its technical analysis shows bearish signs. For example, the Ripple coin is now trading below its 21- and 50-day EMAs while also having many red indicators.|Nevertheless, this altcoin’s price has been rising, as CoinMarketCap data shows an 18% growth in the past 12 months. Thus, experts foresee Ripple trading at $0.78 within Q2 of 2024.|Tether (USDT) Announces Additional CityPay Investment|Meanwhile, Tether (USDT) also made headlines in the crypto market. Most notably, Tether announced it would increase its presence in Eastern Europe by investing more in CityPay, a Georgian payment service. With this development, Citypay will also benefit as it expands into other countries, such as Armenia and Kazakhstan.|Although the investment amount was not disclosed, this Tether news is big as it could see excellent long-term results. Even Paolo Ardoino stated that massive results were achieved after the first Tether investment in CityPay. Due to all these reasons, traders are still keeping an eye on Tether as a powerful force in the crypto market.|Rollblock (RBLK): Outstanding Long-Term Growth Potential|While Ripple and Tether are seeing major developments, Rollblock (RBLK) is emerging as a rising presale star. Market analysts predict that there will be a staggering 1200% increase in the value of RBLK, Rollblock’s native token, in the presale alone. This bullish perspective is because of the increasing popularity of Rollblock’s GambleFi protocol, which is disrupting the $450B online gambling industry.|Rollblock differs from its peers, such as Stake.com, regarding security and user experience. In other words, Rollblock avoids sign-up KYC checks or any additional downloads, making it possible for users to register via email. With this development, you remain anonymous while engaging in this fully-licensed and operational online crypto casino.|However, what makes Rollblock stand out from the competition is its revenue-sharing model. The platform will use up to 30% of its weekly revenue to buy RBLK tokens from the open market. Afterward, half of them are burned while the remaining half is distributed as rewards for staking. This will yield some of the highest staking APYs available anywhere for RBLK holders.|With a $0.01 Stage 1 presale price, RBLK is one of the best altcoins to buy. It has already raised over $250K and could reach $1M before May ends. Not only that, Rollblock has sold over 24M RBLK tokens so far – suggesting a high demand for this altcoin. Thus, market analysts predict a 100x surge for RBLK once it hits Tier-1 exchanges in Q3 of 2024.|Can Rollblock Outpace Ripple and Tether?|Rollblock has an advantage over other altcoins like Ripple thanks to its low market cap of $10M.

"Rachel Wolfson","Finance News","Demand for tokenized treasuries is on the rise. Recent data indicates that more than $1 billion in treasury notes has been tokenized on public blockchain networks.|Andrew O’Neill, Digital Assets Managing Director of S&P Global Ratings, told Cryptonews that the recent launch of BlackRock’s BUIDL fund – currently the world’s largest tokenized treasury fund – seems to be accelerating this trend.|“As shown in the chart, the launch of the BUIDL fund has steepened growth in outstanding volume,” said O’Neill.|“It’s also interesting to note Larry Fink’s public statements on the role of tokenization in the future of BlackRock and financial markets, to understand the context in which this is being done,” O’Neill added.|What Are Tokenized Treasuries?|Indeed, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently mentioned that capital markets could be made more efficient by moving on-chain.|“Tokenized treasuries are digital tokens created on a blockchain that are backed by a portfolio of U.S. government obligations,” O’Neill explained. “These assets are issued both by blockchain-native firms and traditional institutions.”|O’Neill believes that tokenized treasuries are becoming more important because they can help money market funds and their investors manage liquidity.|Tokenized U.S. Treasuries just topped $1B|$26.99T to go pic.twitter.com/PDF0uqksj3|— Camila Russo (@CamiRusso) April 5, 2024|Tokenized Treasuries Help With Liquidity Challenges|For example, O’Neill noted that in times of market volatility, investors may need to meet margin calls on some positions.|“Money market fund investors may seek to redeem their shares in the fund for cash to meet these obligations,” said O’Neill.|O’Neill noted that if many investors redeemed at once, however, this would increase the fund’s liquidity risk.|While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently increased funds’ minimum liquid assets requirements to mitigate this risk, O’Neill believes that tokenization can be beneficial.|Franklin Templeton's Tokenized Money Market Fund Approved & Regulated by The #SEC.

In turn, this could reduce the risk of a run on a fund.|Franklin Templeton recently enabled peer-to-peer transfers on tokens from its FOBXX fund to support such a capability.|Chris Yin, CEO and Co-founder of Plume Network – a layer-2 focused on RWAs – told Cryptonews that FOBXX seeks to provide investors with a secure and liquid investment vehicle.|“FOBXX utilizes the Stellar blockchain for transaction processing, aiming to enhance transparency and reduce operational costs,” said Yin. “It is accessible through the Benji Investments app, which further allows for digital wallet integration.”|Tokenized Treasuries Enable RWAs|Yin added that the real game changer behind tokenized treasuries is the enablement of fractional ownership of real-world assets (RWAs).|“This approach enhances efficiency and allows for fractional ownership, expanding access to a broader base of investors,” Yin explained.|While the concept is still new, tokenized treasuries could be divided into smaller units. Unlike traditional treasury notes with high minimum investment requirements, tokenization allows for even small investors to participate.|“By starting with U.S. Treasuries, which are low-risk and familiar, they provide a gateway for investors to engage with on-chain assets,” said Yin.|Will Tokenized Treasuries Appeal To Investors?|While tokenized treasuries provide a number of benefits, how investors will engage with these new assets is unclear.|This asset class is still emerging, and investor interest likewise,” said O’Neill. “A significant jump in investor interest requires that investors can fully realize the benefits of holding a tokenized asset.”|To achieve this, O’Neill believes that blockchain interoperability is needed to support active secondary markets.|“The ability to mobilize the tokenized asset itself as collateral, rather than having to redeem shares in a fund, is attractive, and this is already technically possible in some cases,” said O’Neill. “However, there is not yet a meaningful secondary market for trading these assets.”|Additionally, O’Neill noted that solutions are required to bridge cash transactions on-chain.|The other important aspect is enabling on-chain cash legs to support delivery-vs-payment transactions,” he said. “If a tokenized asset can be transferred on-chain, but the actual payments for a transaction are made off-chain in a traditional way, there is little gain for investors.”|BLACKROCK'S BUIDL SECURES THIRD OF TOKENIZED TREASURIES MARKET|BlackRock's fund has amassed $381M since its March 20 launch.|This positions BUIDL ahead of Franklin Templeton’s fund, which holds $360M in tokenized Treasuries on Polygon and Stellar.|Source: DL News pic.twitter.com/VH3CQ0CmRH|— Mario Nawfal’s Roundtable (@RoundtableSpace) May 16, 2024|While this may be the case, Blackrock’s BUIDL fund illustrates how investors can access 24/7 liquidity through a smart contract using a stablecoin.

He also mentioned that institutions need to connect their legacy systems to those blockchains.|With this in mind, Yin explained that Plume Network seeks to simplify the process of RWA project deployment, while presenting investors with a blockchain ecosystem to cross-pollinate and invest in various RWAs.|“Plume Network enables RWA composability through its thriving DeFi applications and provides access to high-quality buyers to increase liquidity for all RWAs,” he said. “Through the various projects in our ecosystem, we provide crypto use cases – borrow/lend, trade, speculate, yield farm, etc. – to RWAs in order to uncover net new liquidity.”|Yin also thinks that as institutional investors increasingly adopt RWAs, a new wave of retail investors will inject capital into blockchain ecosystems like never before.|“By initially focusing on building traction within this community and gradually expanding towards institutional adoption, where the pace is typically slower, sustainable growth and mainstream acceptance can be achieved,” Yin remarked.|O’Neill further stated that emerging regulatory frameworks in key jurisdictions will enhance investors’ appetite to engage with stablecoins and the features they enable.|“Such as the BUIDL fund example of disintermediated redemption through a smart contract,” he said.","1715875613000","https://cryptonews.com/news/tokenized-treasuries-are-an-emerging-asset-class-but-adoption-may-take-time.htm","Tokenized treasuries are becoming a global asset class according to S&P Global Ratings, as these provide a number of benefits to institutions","RWA|Tokenization|Tokenized Funds","Tokenized Treasuries Are An Emerging Asset Class, But RWA Adoption May Take Time","Article","Cryptonews"
