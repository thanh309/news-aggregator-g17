# News aggregator - Group 17

## Introduction

In the fast-paced world of blockchain technology, developers and investors need to be updated at all times.
But reading the news manually on different platforms is neither productive nor efficient.

This project is our group effort to build a news aggregator, making a data collection and analysis system for news
related to the blockchain field. It utilizes Java for the core system and Python for a crypto coin price prediction
component.

Our news aggregator aims to provide a lightweight app, prioritizing efficiency and ease of use without compromising
functionality.
